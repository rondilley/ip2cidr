.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
IP To CIDR(\flip2cidr\fP) is a small and fast utility for consolidating lists of
IP addresses to CIDR blocks.  It is pretty fast and was built to work with 10M+
IP lists.  If you have a large IP address list and you want to summarize to
network ranges based on how densely populated the CIDR is, this tool may be able
to help.
